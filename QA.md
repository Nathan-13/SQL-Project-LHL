### What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

•   Incomplete or inaccurate data: Ensuring that the data used for analysis is complete, accurate, and relevant to the goals.

•   Data integrity: Check for data duplication, missing values, or inconsistencies in the data.

•   Query performance: Consider potential performance issues for large datasets or complex queries.


### QA Process:
### Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

•   Data Profiling: Examine the data to identify inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values. Data profiling tools can 
help discover data quality issues.

•   Data Validation: Run sample queries to validate data accuracy against expected results or business logic.

    SELECT productsku, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
    FROM all_sessions

    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    
    
    -- Check for duplicate entries in the all_sessions table
    SELECT sku, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
    FROM products
    GROUP BY sku
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
